      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Adventuring in the Mad River Adventures it takes a while to learn the
        river, but once done, it feels like you have been doing it your whole
        life. That’s when We knew that the River Adventures was home for many
        Adventurer, or we guess more of a retreat. When they're out there,
        they're in a state of flow. Even a bad day on the river is better than a
        good day in most other places. We realized this about halfway through
        our first summer. That’s when we knew that we can deliver.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
